                 <b>Long Word Labeling Abbreviation Technique for Text Visualization</b>
                </blue>
                <br><br>
                I understand that:<br><br>

                a.	I am participating in a user study that is part of an academic research project within the scope of a Master’s thesis. The purpose of this study is to analyze how people create English word abbreviations and to evaluate how understandable English word abbreviations can be understood.<br>
                b.	My participation will consist of creating original abbreviations for given English words and attempting to give original for supplied English abbreviations.<br>
                c.	The data collected is comprised of the set of user generated word abbreviations and the set of original words supplied as part of the study (not abbreviated).<br>
                d.	This research is being conducted by Dr. Christopher Collins and Mariana Akemi Shimabukuro, members of the vialab (Visualization for Information Analysis Laboratory) at the University of Ontario Institute of Technology.<br>
                e.	The average duration of this study is 30 minutes.<br>
                f.	The collected data will be hosted on vialab’s servers at the University of Ontario Institute of Technology.<br>
                g.	My participation is voluntary and this agreement does not require me to waive my legal rights.<br><br>

                <b>Risks and Benefits</b><br><br>

                h.	I will be given $4 for my participation, which will be paid through CrowdFlower.<br>
                i.	The research community will benefit from this study by having a better understanding on how people create abbreviations and how well they are able to understand those abbreviations.<br>
                j.	The results will benefit end-users by making it easier to read and understand shortened versions (abbreviations) of words in digital applications.<br>
                k.	Performing the tasks involve no significant physical, psychological, social or economic risks.  <br>
                l.	The purpose of this study is to collect answers; there is no evaluation of participants skills.<br><br>

                <b>Publication of Results</b><br><br>

                m.	The data collected during this study may be presented in resulting publications as absolute numbers or statistics, with any identifying information removed.<br><br>

                <b>Confidentiality</b><br><br>

                n.	CrowdFlower will never have access to data collected as part of this study. In addition, the researchers will never have access to personal information about participants, as per CrowdFlower terms of service.<br>
                o.	Data stripped of all direct or indirect identifiers will be made publicly available by the researchers after the end of the study.<br>
                p.	I agree that my data, stripped of all identifiers, may be used for secondary purposes, as a consequence of being made publicly available. <br><br>

                <b>Anonymity</b><br><br>
                
                q.	CrowdFlower will keep a record of my participation, which CrowdFlower can use according to its Privacy Policy and Terms of Service.<br>
                r.	Neither my CrowdFlower ID nor any personal information will be collected or used by the researchers.<br>
                s.	The collected data is anonymized (i.e., does not contain direct identifiers). The only link between my data and my identity is the exit code generated at the end of the session, which will be kept by me, CrowdFlower, and the researchers.<br>
                t.	By 30/01/2017 the data will be completely stripped of all indirect identifiers, making it impossible to link my identity to the collected data.<br>
                u.	I will not be contacted for follow-up questions.<br><br>

                <b>Withdrawal</b><br><br>

                v.	If I would like to withdraw during the study and waive my compensation, I can simply close the study page on my browser.<br>
                w.	If I would like to withdraw during the study and collect my compensation, I should click on the Withdraw button to jump to the end of the study session, then copy and paste the exit code onto the CrowdFlower study page.<br>
                x.	To withdraw after the study has been completed, I should keep my exit code and send it to marianaakemi.shimabukuro@uoit.ca until 30/01/2017 stating my intention to withdraw. My data will be permanently deleted.<br><br>

                This study has been approved by the UOIT Research Ethics Board REB 13926 on 05/17/2016.<br><br>
